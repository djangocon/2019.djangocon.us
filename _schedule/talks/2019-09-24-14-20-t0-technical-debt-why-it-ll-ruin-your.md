## Abstract
We are used to think that Technical Debt is just bad/ugly code, with this talk I want to propose a bigger picture view of what we can call Technical Debt with a Sustainable Software era, how can we identify bottlenecks that are generating more debt and then how to deal with it.

After joined on a few ongoing projects as a developer I noticed a lot of smells for bottlenecks on the product development and delivery phases, those issues are usually named as Technical Debt issues by the development teams but not the healthy code is just a reflection of the teams struggles, when I say Teams I mean the entire companies' structures and relations. Those relations can have a lot of problems and usually those problems are only visible on the code written.
