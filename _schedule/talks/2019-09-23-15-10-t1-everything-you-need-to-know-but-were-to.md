abstract: You know you're curious. How are data classes different from other Python
  classes? Why can't I just use a dictionary? How do I even use these in my existing
  applications? Come on a cross-language comparative journey to discover just what
  are, and how best to use, Python 3.7's classiest new feature.

What makes this better than using a normal object or dictionary? Are they actually more memory efficient? Why shouldn't I just write my own dunder methods for this? Come explore the ins, outs, and whys of Data Classes by looking at them from lenses both inside and outside of Python! Comparing language features might be pitting apples against oranges, but sometimes, it's just as important to know what a feature is not to use it effectively. So let's throw some comparative color onto the pep - we may just find the perfect spot in your developer toolbox for the data class to live. Join me for this can't miss deep dive into data classiness.
