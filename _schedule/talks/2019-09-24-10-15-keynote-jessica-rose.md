Maybe you’ve been doing too much for too long. And if you have, there’s the very real possibility that this is going to hurt you. Occupational burnout is the too common outcome of extended, seemingly-inescapable stress. In this talk we’ll look at the impact of burnout, how to manage your way through it and a potential, unexpected upside. Come along to learn more about burnout, cognitive psychology and all the ways that your brain is (fascinatingly) terrible.
