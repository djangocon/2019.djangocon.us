Still debugging your code by using print? Learn how to level up your ability to troubleshoot complex code situations by using the power of a fully-featured debugger in this talk aimed at all levels of programming ability.

Debuggers allow you to examine your program state, watch as the values of important variables change, and even modify the content of variables on the fly. Once I gave up using print to debug and troubleshoot, my productivity as a programmer increased, and yours can too!

I'll showcase the variety of debugger tools available - from `pdb`, the simplest command line debugger that's part of the standard library, to fancy graphical debuggers available in Python IDEs. Join me as we walk through real code together using debugger tools in a hands-on way to help us diagnose problems and bugs. The skills you'll learn in this talk will allow you to quickly use these tools in your own code bases for fun, school, or work.
