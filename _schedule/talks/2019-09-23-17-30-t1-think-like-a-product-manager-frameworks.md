<p>Ever been working on a project without a strong Product Manager (or no Product Manager) and wondered if you're building the right thing?  Or considered Product Management as your next career move?  </p>

<p>In this talk, you'll learn from an experienced PM about how to apply straightforward product frameworks from the first day you're back at work that will improve your team's output, impact and connection to your company and customers.</p>

<p>We'll cover how to do this in four crucial phases of the product lifecycle:
<ul>
<li>Starting a project</li>
<li>Cutting scope</li>
<li>Launching a new product or feature</li>
<li>Evaluating a change</li>
</ul>
