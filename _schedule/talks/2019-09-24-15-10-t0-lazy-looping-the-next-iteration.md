abstract: In this talk we'll learn about the properties of iterators, learn how to
  create our own iterators with generators, and take a look at how iterators and generators
  allow us to write our looping code in a fundamentally different way.

Embracing Python's iterators and generators often allow us to drastically restructure our code for the better. They allow for writing code more like a recipe of descriptive steps, which often improves code readability.

We'll start off this talk by reviewing iterables, iterators, and generators. Then we'll take a detailed look at a number of interesting and useful leverage Python's fancy iterators and generators for good.

We'll learn about iterators and generators and discuss making your own. We'll also discuss best practices around using and creating iterable helper functions that are iterator-aware.

Attendees will walk away from this session with specific actionable recommendations for refactoring their own code as well as a wealth of new topics to look deeper into after the session.
