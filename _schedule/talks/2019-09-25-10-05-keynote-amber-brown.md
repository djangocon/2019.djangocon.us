Her talk is called The Natural State of Computers. Asynchronicity is coming to Django. Why is this such a big deal, and what problems does it solve? By looking at the problem domain of Django and Python, we can separate the problems into ones that utilising asynchronous techniques makes easier, and the ones that it makes harder, and learn how to tell when this is the case.
