abstract: Unit tests are great, but they don’t catch all bugs because they don’t test
  features like a user. Never fear! Let’s learn how to write robust, scalable Web
  UI tests using Python, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack
  for any Web app.

Unit tests are a great way to start Web app testing and automation, but the buck doesn’t stop there. Black-box feature tests that interact with the app like a user are just as important. They catch things unit tests cannot. The challenge is that Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously unreliable. Plus, the variety of browsers and versions can feel overwhelming. So, how can we write tests well?

In this talk, we’ll cover:

* Using Selenium WebDriver like a pro
* Modeling Web UI interactions in Python code
* Handling multiple browsers
* Writing “good” feature tests that are efficient, robust, and readable
* Deciding what should and should not be tested with automation

We will use Python 3, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver for writing our tests. We will use the DuckDuckGo website as our product under test. After this talk, you’ll be able to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for any Web app, including Django and Flask apps. There will be plenty of example code available, too.
