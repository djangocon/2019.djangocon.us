  JBS Solutions has developed custom web applications
  for clients from small to large, supporting e-commerce,
  appointment scheduling, advertising, nationally televised events,
  data warehousing/business intelligence and many others.
  They work primarily in Django, but other technologies occasionally
  fit applications better (even Microsoft - a separate team is a
  Gold Application Development partner.)
