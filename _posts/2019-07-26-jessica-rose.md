Jessica Rose is a passionate advocate for more equal access to technical education and meaningful work in technology. She works with Mozilla, leading the TechSpeakers program. Mozilla TechSpeakers helps new and established voices with their technical outreach through volunteer advocacy. Jess founded the Open Code meetup series, co-founded Trans*Code and hosts the Pursuit podcast.

Her talk is called Burnout and Balance. Maybe you've been doing too much for too long. And if you have, there's the very real possibility that this is going to hurt you. Occupational burnout is the too common outcome of extended, seemingly-inescapable stress. In this talk we'll look at the impact of burnout, how to manage your way through it and a potential, unexpected upside. Come along to learn more about burnout, cognitive psychology and all the ways that your brain is (fascinatingly) terrible.
