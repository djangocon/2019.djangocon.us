This is [Caktus Group's](https://www.caktusgroup.com/?utm_source=djangoconsite&utm_medium=blog01&utm_campaign=djangocon2019) tenth year sponsoring DjangoCon US, and their second year hosting the Caktus Mini Gold event. Your first round is free, and whoever shoots the lowers score will win a _$100 Amazon gift card. *_

Last year’s Caktus Mini Golf event was a blast! More than 30 Djangonauts putted their way through the challenging course, talking Django while showing off their putt-putt skills.

Look out for the Caktus insert in your conference tote bag. On the back of the insert is a free pass to Tiki Town Adventure Golf for Wednesday, September 25, at 7:00 p.m. The first 15 people to [RSVP for the event](https://learn.caktusgroup.com/djangocon19?utm_source=djangoconsite&utm_medium=blog01&utm_campaign=djangocon2019) will also receive a $10 credit for Lyft, which you can use from the conference hotel. Carpooling is strongly encouraged.
