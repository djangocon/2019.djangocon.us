---
The [call for proposals for DjangoCon US 2019](https://www.papercall.io/djangocon-us-2019) is open, and we would love to have you (yes, you!) help us select our talks and tutorials this year. We strive to create a schedule that appeals to the wider community, and the best way for us to do that is by having members of said community vote for the talks you’d like to see. If you are interested in guiding the 2019 program, this is your chance!

We welcome reviewers with all levels of experience, even those brand new to the community. You don’t need to be a Django expert, a previous reviewer, or a frequent DjangoCon US attendee to provide great feedback on how to make a program that appeals to everyone!

If you are interested in volunteering as a community reviewer, please send an email to [program@djangocon.us](mailto:program@djangocon.us) and we’ll help you get started! Please note, we can only grant access to around 30 community reviewers and it will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
