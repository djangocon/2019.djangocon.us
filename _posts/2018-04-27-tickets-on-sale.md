title: "Catch That Worm! Early Bird Tickets On Sale Now"
---
We know you're as excited as we are to get your DjangoCon US ticket, and your wait is over! Tickets are [on sale now]({{site.ticket_link}}) and more information is available on our [tickets](/tickets/) page.

Here's what you need to know:

## Prices

- Early Bird Individual Rate: $495 (will increase to $595 once early bird tickets sell out)
- Early Bird Corporate Rate: $695 (will increase to $795 once early bird tickets sell out)
- **New Ticket** &mdash; Patron Rate: $995
- **New Ticket** &mdash; Corporate Concierge Service: $995 per ticket
- Discounted Rate: $295
- Tutorials: $195 per session

**Patron:** Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. This year, we're introducing a ticket type just for you: the Patron ticket. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.

**Corporate Concierge Service**: If your company wants to purchase several tickets in advance, but decide who will be attending the conference at a later date, please use our Corporate Concierge Service. Buy your tickets in bulk and we'll send you a registration code your employees can use to register when you're ready. We will also send you a paper invoice for record-keeping if you need.

You can pre-register for tutorials! Just add a morning and/or afternoon tutorial session to your order, and we'll send you a registration code once our tutorial schedule is released. (Please choose specific tutorials as soon as possible once the schedule is released; we cannot guarantee you a slot in a specific session but we'll do our best to send you lots of reminders.)
