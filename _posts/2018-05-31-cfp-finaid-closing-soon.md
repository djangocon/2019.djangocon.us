Don't miss out on your chance to speak at DjangoCon US or get some financial help with attending the conference! Our Call for Proposals and applications for financial aid both close on June 3, 2018, [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) (anywhere on earth).

We want to hear about your experience with and around Django. Remember, we encourage you to submit talks that might be:

- for Django users of all levels, including beginners or advanced developers
- still being developed, or in progress
- non-technical in nature

Speaker mentors and more information about speaking at DjangoCon US is also available on our [speaking](/speaking/) and [speaker resources](/speaking/speaker-resources/) page.


Every year we get questions from people who don’t feel like they are the type of person we’re looking for, but they still need financial help to attend DjangoCon US. Let us reassure you: we’re not looking to give any particular person funding! If you’re a member of an underrepresented group (whatever that means to you), if you have a lower income, or if your circumstances at this moment mean you need help to come to DjangoCon US, we want you to apply and will do our best to meet your needs. If you’re not sure whether or not you should apply for financial aid… the answer is **yes**. If you need aid, you should apply!

Get answers to common questions about financial aid on the [financial aid](/financial-aid/) page.
