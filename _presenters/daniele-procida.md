I am a Django Project core developer and former vice-president of the Django Software Foundation. I work at Divio, where I have the opportunity to contribute to a number of open-source Python/Django projects.

Since 2015, I've been involved in the growing pan-African Python movement, and have been delighted to see how the international Python community has helped support the development of events and local communities in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Ghana.
