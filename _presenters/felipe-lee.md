I’m a full stack developer at UT Austin. I self-describe as a dog person, but somehow have 3-4 cats (one comes and goes) and no dogs at the moment. Interestingly, two of my cats were born the very first day I started as a developer so they’ve grown up with my career :smiley_cat: On my spare time I like to learn about tech I don’t use at work, play video games like Elder Scrolls, and spend with my partner and friends.
