Hi, I’m Cara! I’m a full-stack web developer and I love taking ideas from prototype to production - gnarly configs included. I’m passionate about empowering more women to become software engineers and to advance in their careers in tech. I currently serve as founder and CEO of Caeli - The Modular Notebook.
