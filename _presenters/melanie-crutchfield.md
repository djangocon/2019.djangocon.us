Melanie is a creator, tinkerer, and prisoner of hope (h/t Cornel West). She peddles happiness at [FiveUpApp.com](http://fiveupapp.com) and has been known to engage in high-fivery. (Especially windmill high-fives.)

Melanie has been learning Python and Django for a handful of years and doesn’t plan to stop. She is an organizer with PyLadies San Diego, the San Diego Python User Group, and Django Girls San Diego. She loves helping people get their feet wet in programming and helping promote diversity in tech. She’s a mental health advocate, an anti-racism activist, and a chocolate enthusiast.

Melanie believes in kindness, Ben and Jerry’s Salted Carmel Core ice cream, and spunk. And you.
