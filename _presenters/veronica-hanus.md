Before becoming a programmer, Veronica was a researcher with an eye for process improvement (she helped pick the Mars Curiosity Rover’s landing site!). She loves exploring the web and teaching, and speaks on building the tooling & docs you need and has co-taught a PyCon tutorial on using web-scraping and machine learning to predict Oscar winners. When she isn’t thinking about how the web can be better for developers, she enjoys blogging and snuggling as many cats as possible.
