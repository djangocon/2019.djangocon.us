I have a Masters degree in Computer Science and over 5 years of professional experience (plus a few more as a hobbyist). I’ve worked with several technologies, Python/Django being the one(s) I spent the most time with. I’m currently working as a consultant and full stack developer (Django/React) at Vinta Software, a brazilian development studio that strives for quality over quantity and focuses on delivering actual value to customers.

I also like to work on side-projects, although my last big ones took place a while ago. I got the 4th Place in the World at Microsoft's Imagine Cup in 2011, in the Game Design Category with a [puzzle-like computer game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_pq3fBnH8I) made by my team and competed again with [another game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QqGDRLUbfI) in 2012. I've also won the 1st National Place in the same competition in 2015, in the Citizenship category, where my team and I developed an app for helping with the treatment for Autism.
