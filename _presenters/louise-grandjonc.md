Hi, I'm Louise, I am a software developer working at citus data (now Microsoft). I have been a python/django developer for 5 years, and I just love it, that and postgreSQL. I am always curious about learning SQL and enjoy working on performance! I am involved in the postgres community as well, as a speaker and also a member of postgresWomen, a group to promote diversity in the world of databases.
