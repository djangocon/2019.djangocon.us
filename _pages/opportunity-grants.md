## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are opportunity grants?
They are grants to encourage and facilitate participation of those who otherwise might not be able to attend the conference. They can be used for conference related expenses like travel, lodging, etc.

### Why did the name change to "opportunity grants"?
We renamed "financial aid" to "opportunity grants" in an effort to become a more inclusive and diverse conference. We feel the wording "opportunity grants" makes a positive shift towards being a thriving, supportive and trusting community.

### Do I need to be a speaker, first time attendee, or a member of an underrepresented group to receive an opportunity grant?

We try to allocate opportunity grants to a diverse set of attendees based on need. Our review process is holistic and takes into account many different factors, most importantly being the impact we think attending DjangoCon US will have on the applicant. {% comment %}We want to encourage everyone who needs aid to apply for it. Do not rule yourself out before you have even applied!{% endcomment %}

### When will I receive my opportunity grant?

The opportunity grant is paid to the recipient at the conference or shortly after.

### How will I receive my opportunity grant?

The opportunity grant is paid to the recipient in the form of a check for US account holders. A bank transfer is used for non-US account holders. We typically use TransferWise for international payments, but have used other services for currencies they do not support.

We require receipts for the items that the opportunity grant was spent on.

### Is there anything I should know if I am traveling into the U.S. from another country?

If you are traveling into the United States, we strongly encourage you to to wait to purchase airfare or book a hotel room until after your visa has been accepted.

You can request a visa letter by <a href="mailto:{{site.visa_email}}">emailing us</a>.

If you are denied entry to the US with a valid visa, we will pay your non-refundable costs (up to the amount of your opportunity grant).

### What if there is an emergency and I am not able to attend?

If you are denied entry to the US with a valid visa, we will pay your non-refundable costs (up to the amount of your opportunity grant). For other emergencies or additional costs, we will review the recipient’s need on a case by case basis.
