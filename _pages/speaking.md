## Proposing to DjangoCon US

### Selection process

We’ll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees. Volunteers from the Django community are invited to help us pick talks, and we rely heavily on them to help us select ones that are interesting and beneficial to our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and collectively decide which ones to accept.

### Talks (October 15th, 16th, &amp; 17th)

Length: 20-25 minutes or 40-45 minutes

We are looking for original and interesting talks that can benefit the diverse interests of our audience. Don’t feel boxed into Django-centric themes; we also love talks about community, web development, user experience, and more. If you’re a first timer - don’t fret! We would love to be remembered as the conference where you started your speaking career.

Here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last couple of years:

* [DjangoCon US 2017 Talks](https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/)
* [DjangoCon US 2016 Talks](https://2016.djangocon.us/schedule/general-sessions/)

### Tutorials (October 14th)

Length: 3-3.5 hours

We’re open to all kinds of ideas, especially ones we haven’t thought of! Technical tutorials tend to be more popular, but we welcome all topics. Tutorials can be targeted at any experience level &mdash; just be sure to indicate clearly what you expect your students to already know or have experience with.

Still unsure if you should submit? Not only will we cover your DjangoCon US ticket, but tutorials are compensated.

### Lightning Talks :zap: (October 15th, 16th, &amp; 17th)

Not up for a full-on talk or tutorial? Looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are talks under 5 minutes with or without slides on almost any topic you want! Even if you’re nervous or shy, remember: it’s a **maximum** of 5 minutes. Sign-ups will happen at the conference.
